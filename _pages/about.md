## About me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/masayoshi-tomizuka). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). During my study in Berkeley, I have also spent time in [FANUC Coporation](https://www.fanuc.co.jp/) and FANUC Advanced Research Lab as an intern. 

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary combination of robotics, optimization, learning and control theories with applications to **human-robot collaboration**. I am focused on developing algorithms for collaborative robots to perceive and anticipate humans, and hereinafter make human-aware task planning and motion planning.
